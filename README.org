* DSync

DSync is a dead-simple P2P file synchronization tool using the SSH protocol.

The synchronization is 2-way, and the algorithm used to determine the correct version to use simply just looks at the mtime (last modified time) of a file on both ends, and the one with the later one gets synchronized to the other side.

* Building / Running

To build, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go build ./cmd/dsync
#+END_SRC

To run, execute the resulting file, or the following command directly:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go run ./cmd/dsync
#+END_SRC
