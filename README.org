* DSync

DSync is a dead-simple P2P file synchronization tool using the SSH protocol.

The algorithm used to determine the correct version to use simply looks at the mtime (last modified time) of a file on all ends, and the one with the latest gets synchronized to the rest.

* Building / Running

To build, simply run:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go build ./cmd/dsync
#+END_SRC

To run, execute the resulting file, or the following command directly:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
go run ./cmd/dsync
#+END_SRC
